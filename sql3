1.Obtain the details of the boats reserved by #Sailor_Name.
SELECT b.* FROM BOAT b JOIN RESERVES r ON b.BID = r.BID JOIN SAILOR s ON r.SID = s.SID WHERE s.SName = 'Sailor A';

2.Retrieve the BID of the boats reserved necessarily by all the sailors
SELECT BID FROM RESERVES GROUP BY BID HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT SID) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SAILOR);

3.Find the number of boats reserved by each sailor. Display the Sailor_Name along with the number of boats reserved
SELECT s.SName, COUNT(r.BID) AS NumberOfBoatsReserved FROM SAILOR s LEFT JOIN RESERVES r ON s.SID = r.SID GROUP BY s.SID, s.SName;
